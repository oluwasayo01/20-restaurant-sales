# Running the pipeline
In case the code breaks in the first run within your kubeflow cluster, try to run the following command in the pipeline notebook `restaurant-prediction-pipeline.ipynb`
```notebook
!pip install pandas scikit-learn --user
```

Restart  the kernel then run the notebook again.
